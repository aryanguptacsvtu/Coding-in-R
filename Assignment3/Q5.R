# QUESTION :-
# Demonstrate vector recycling by creating one vector of length 4 and another of length 10, then perform an addition operation. 
# Print the resulting vector. 


# Create the vectors
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
b <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

# Perform the addition operation
result <- a + b

# Print the resulting vector
print(result)
# Output :-
# [1]  11  22  33  44  51  62  73  84  91 102
