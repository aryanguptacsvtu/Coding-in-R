# QUESTION :-
# Store as a third object the values returned by omitting the first and last values of your vector from (6.). 


# Create a new vector by omitting the first and last values of 'vec'
remaining <- vec[-c(1, length(vec))]

# Print the resulting vector
print(remaining)
# Output :-
#[1]   3.75   4.50   5.25   6.00   2.00  -5.10 -33.00   2.00  -5.10 -33.00
